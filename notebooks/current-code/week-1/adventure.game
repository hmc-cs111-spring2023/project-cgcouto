<rooms> {
    <start>(treasure is north, cave is south) {
        You find yourself in a dark room. A door leads to the north, while a cave opens to the south.
    }
    <cave>(start is north) {
        You've arrived in a dingy cave. You can go north to return to the starting room.
    }
    <treasure>() {
        Wow, there's a treasure chest in here! You can't open it though (at least not yet). The starting room resides to the south.
    }
